# TriviaGame

This Trivia Game was created to become familiar with Javascript timers, and jQuery. The site uses a Bootstrap framework. The quiz focuses on the Mythos stories written by H.P. Lovecraft.
 
Once the quiz is started, the timer will count down until either the question has been answered by clicking on a button, or time has run out. You will then be told if the answer you selected was correct or not, or a notice that the time is up will be displayed. If time ran out, or the wrong answer was entered, the correct answer will then be displayed. Once this is done a new question will be displayed and the countdown will begin anew.
 
After all questions have been asked and answered, the game will display the total correct and incorrect answers that were given, and display a button to begin the quiz again.
